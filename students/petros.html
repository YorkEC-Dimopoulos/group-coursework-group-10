                Hi, I am Petros and I have been programming for <br>
                some year while studying in universities abroad.
                I mainly program in java and I have made different projects such as<br>
                 tretris game or a 3D simultion of the solar system.
                Even though I like programming music is my main passion and <br>
                I play the drums and guitar in my free time or in bands.<br>
                For this project I worked as a group leader coordinating the team<br> 
                and splitting tasks and in addition implementing the faq and review <br>
                pages for this website.
