            I'm 20 years old and I am from Kazakhstan.
            My interest in computers began in early childhood; in particular, I started interacting with computers at the age of four.
            I believe that this early exposure to computers motivated me to pursue a career in programming, as it did for many others.
            I began studying programming five years ago, and during this time I have worked on numerous projects, created a great deal, learned extensively, and also forgotten some things along the way. I have even had the opportunity to work in companies, and I have never grown tired of programming. I am determined to continue developing my skills in the future.
            Therefore, what I value most in programming is its flexibility and the constant opportunity to face new challenges.

                <p>This was not my first project; however, I found it rather challenging. Despite the difficulties, I gained a significant amount of new knowledge and a deeper understanding of various aspects of programming. I generally prefer backend development, but I also enjoyed the frontend part of the project because it allows for creativity, thoughtful design decisions, and visualisation. The moment when you can clearly see the completed result after a long period of work is particularly satisfying and rewarding. This project was personally demanding and required a considerable amount of time, but I do not regret it in the slightest.</p>
                <h2>Resources I used during the project:</h2>
                <ul>
