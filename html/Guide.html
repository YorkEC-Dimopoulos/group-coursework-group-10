    <h1>Benefits of Electric Cars</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Health and Environment</h2>
    <p>
        Electric cars are one of the best ways to protect the environment. They don't pollute air like regular cars making them ideal for people who are  environmentally cautious. Because they don't pollute air they are much safer for the health of not just humans but other living beings.
    </p>

    <h2>Batteries</h2>
    <p>
        Batteries of electric cars can last around 12 to 15 years if the environment is good. Most electric cars have a good warranty on batteries. Electric car battery warranty can last around 8 years depending on manufacturer.
    </p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>

    <p>
        Although the price of electric vehicles was high at the beginning with the recent advancements in technology, the price of electric cars decreased significantly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Fuel Economy, Energy Security and Resilience</h2>
    <p>
        Because electric cars use electricity instead of regular fuel sources they are more efficient in saving traditional energy sources like oil that can vanish. Even switching to hybrid electric vehicles can greatly save fuel sources. It is believed that switching to electrical vehicles can save up to 30% of US oil reserves.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Infrastructure Availability</h2>
    <p>
        Due to recent advancements in technology, charging an electric car was never that easy. Most gas stations or car parking for cars have EV chargers. EV charging stations can even be found next to major highways. Some highways even charge your electric cars while driving on them.
