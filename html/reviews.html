            <p>
                The Model K combines raw power (520 HP) with an ultra-luxurious velvet interior. 
                The 3D logo and LED Matrix lights make it unmistakable on the road. It defines a new era 
                of luxury electric travel.

                With an 11-year battery warranty, Model P is the most sensible choice for long-term owners. 
                It may not be as fast as the K, but it is built to last and offers exceptional value for money.

                The operating system in the new Group 10 fleet is flawless. The Over-the-Air (OTA) updates 
                have already added two new driving modes since we started our long-term test. 
                The interface is snappy, intuitive, and the voice assistant actually understands accents!

                We switched to the Group 10 Electric Fleet last year and haven't looked back. 
                Charging at home is so convenient, and the kids love the spacious back seats.

                I just drove my Model K from Thessaloniki to Vienna. I was worried about charging stops, 
                but the navigation planned everything perfectly. The seats remained comfortable even 
                after 10 hours of driving.
