                It all started in the Computer Science class in 4th grade, where
                the teacher showed us MicroWords Pro&#169;. This created a spark
                in me to pursue programming, leading me to C++, Python (in English this time),
                Ruby, Go, and currently Rust and Assembly x86.<br>
                At around 15, I thought "OK, I know 3 programming languages, let's find
                something new in the IT sector", and fell upon Ethical Hacking.<br>
                After many YouTube videos and some experimenting with hacking tools,
                I decided I prefer the offensive side of cybersecurity, leading me to
                start subscriptions with providers like HackTheBox, playing OverTheWire,
                and experimenting with Metasploitable (version 2 at the time).<br>
                Currently I am trying to get my Computer Science degree, as I also spend
                time enriching my Ethical Hacking/Penetration Testing knowledge and
                perfecting my technique.

                I have been interested and actively learning about the IT sector for the past 15
                years, and currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, as I 
                learn more about Penetration Testing.
