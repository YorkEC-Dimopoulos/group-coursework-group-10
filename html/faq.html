            <h3 class="capital">
                How long does the battery warranty last?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our battery and electric motor warranty covers up to 11 years depending on the specific model 
                (Model K, Model P). We stand by our engineering to ensure your peace of mind.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                How fast can I charge my car?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Using our 900V high-voltage architecture, vehicles can charge from 10% to 80% in approximately 
                18 minutes at a DC fast charger. For home charging, a standard Wallbox takes about 4-6 hours 
                for a full charge.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                Where can I find spare parts?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We offer comprehensive spare parts kits, including maintenance and emergency kits. 
                Please visit our <a href="spare_parts.html">Spare Parts</a> page for full details.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                What is the real-world range?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our vehicles are designed to exceed expectations. The Model K achieves over 500km on a single charge 
                under normal driving conditions, making range anxiety a thing of the past.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                Are these cars safe in an accident?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Absolutely. All our models have achieved a 5-Star Safety Rating. They are equipped with advanced 
                collision avoidance systems, automatic emergency braking, and a rigid safety cell to protect 
                all passengers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                How does cold weather affect the battery?
            </h3>
            <p>
                While all batteries lose some efficiency in extreme cold, our vehicles are equipped with a 
                standard Heat Pump. This technology recycles waste heat to warm the cabin and battery, 
                minimizing range loss during winter months.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                How much money will I save compared to a gas car?
            </h3>
            <p>
                On average, electricity costs one-third as much as petrol for the same distance driven. 
                Additionally, with no oil changes, spark plugs, or transmission maintenance, service costs 
                are significantly lower over the life of the car.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                What happens to the battery after it dies?
            </h3>
            <p>
                We are committed to a circular economy. Once a battery reaches the end of its life in a car, 
                it is either repurposed for home energy storage or 95% of its materials (lithium, cobalt, nickel) 
                are recycled to build new batteries.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                Do I need to visit a dealer for software updates?
            </h3>
            <p>
                No. All our models come equipped with Over-the-Air (OTA) capabilities. Your car will update 
                itself automatically while parked at home, adding new features and performance improvements 
                without you lifting a finger.
            </p>

            <h3 class="capital">
                How can I book a test drive?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can schedule a test drive at any of our showrooms. Simply contact our support team, 
                and we will bring the car to your home for a personal demonstration.
