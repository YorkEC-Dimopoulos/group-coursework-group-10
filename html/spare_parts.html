                Here you can view the available spare parts for our electric car models.<br>
                The spare parts are <!-- maybe change this --> compatible with all our models,
                with the exception of the Interior Care Kit - which is exclusive to
                our high-class SUV model K.

                    The maintenance kit is mostly comprised of consumables like a set
                    of 2 Cabin HEPA filters, an Aero-Blade Wheel Inserts replacement
                    pack, and a 12V Lithium-Ion Battery, to make sure your car always
                    runs in top condition.

                <p class="description" id="emergency-text">
                    The emergency kit is equipped with a foldable warning triangle,
                    2 High-Visibility vests, a Tire Sealant & Compressor, a Mobile Connector
                    to charge your car wherever you are, and a 7m Type 2 to Type 2 Charging Cable,
                    allowing you to use public chargers even if there's someone parked in front of them.

                <p class="description" id="interior-text">
                    The interior care kit offers the ultimate luxury in your model K, by giving you
                    all the things you need to take care of the Red Velvet leather seats, the dashboard,
                    and the internal screens, without damaging any part of the car.<br>
                    The screen cleaning solution is amonia-free, in order to preserve the anti-glare
                    coating of all the screens in the interior of the car.
